## 🚀 Deployment Instructions

### Netlify Deployment (Recommended for SSR)

1. **Connect to Netlify:**
   ```bash
   # Option 1: Via Netlify CLI
   npm install -g netlify-cli
   netlify init
   
   # Option 2: Via Netlify Dashboard
   # Connect your GitHub repository at https://app.netlify.com
   ```

2. **Build Settings in Netlify Dashboard:**
   ```
   Build command: npm run build:netlify
   Publish directory: dist/profiles-sharing-app/browser
   Functions directory: (auto-detected)
   ```

3. **Environment Variables (if needed):**
   ```
   NODE_ENV=production
   ANGULAR_ENV=netlify
   ```

### Alternative Deployment Options

#### Docker Deployment
```bash
# Build Docker image
npm run docker:build

# Run container
npm run docker:run
```

#### PM2 Production Deployment
```bash
# Build for production
npm run build:prod

# Start with PM2
npm run pm2:start
```

#### Standard Node.js Deployment
```bash
# Build for production
npm run build:prod

# Start server
npm run start:prod
```

## ⚠️ Known Warnings (Non-blocking)

1. **SCSS Budget Warnings**: Some component styles exceed 6KB budget
   - Non-critical, app still functions perfectly
   - Consider splitting large styles if needed

2. **CommonJS Module Warnings**: `qrcode` and `jsqr` libraries
   - Non-critical, libraries work correctly
   - No ESM alternatives available

## 🧪 Testing

Tests are configured but require Chrome browser:
```bash
# Install Chrome or set CHROME_BIN environment variable
export CHROME_BIN="/path/to/chrome"
npm run test:ci
```
